### Introduction
This repo contains our work on the second project in the course about graphics, computer vision and image processing at TAU during the spring semester of 2023.
In this project, we implemented in Python the [Ray Tracing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)), which is an algorithm for rendering scenes from a scene description file.
You can see some of our example outputs in the [output folder](output).
